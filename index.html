        <p class="hero-subtitle">
          Just like Gamban and GamStop protect people from gambling, LoanBan
          would let individuals block themselves from taking out high-interest
          loans before debt spirals begin.

    <!-- WHY SECTION -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Why do we need LoanBan?</h2>
      <p>
        When people hit a financial crisis, they often feel they have nowhere
        else to turn. High-interest and short-term loans are advertised as quick
        fixes, but the huge interest and fees can quickly turn into an
        unmanageable debt spiral.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gambling already has self-exclusion tools like
        <span class="highlight">GamStop</span> and
        <span class="highlight">Gamban</span>, which allow people to block
        themselves from betting sites and apps. There is no equivalent
        protection for high-interest loans – even though the harm can be just as
        severe.
      </p>
      <p>
        LoanBan is a simple idea: give people the power to say "no" to loans
        before they reach breaking point.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS + BENEFITS -->
    <section id="how-it-works" class="two-column container">
      <div>
        <h2>How a loan self-exclusion register could work</h2>
        <p>
          A national register would allow individuals to voluntarily sign up and
          block themselves from being approved for certain types of loans, such
          as high-cost short-term credit or other high-risk borrowing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lenders and credit providers would be required to check the register
          before issuing a loan. If someone has chosen to self-exclude, the
          application is declined – no questions asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system could be run by credit reference agencies or an
          independent, regulated body – similar to how gambling self-exclusion
          schemes are managed today.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Who would this help?</h2>
        <p>
          LoanBan is for anyone who knows loans could be dangerous for them in a
          crisis – including:
        </p>
        <ul class="pill-list">
          <li class="pill">People in recovery from problem debt</li>
          <li class="pill">Those with mental health difficulties</li>
          <li class="pill">Individuals facing instability or abuse</li>
          <li class="pill">Anyone who wants a safety brake on borrowing</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Self-exclusion is not a cure-all</strong> – but it is a
          powerful, practical tool that people can choose for themselves. It
          works alongside financial advice, debt support and fairer lending
          rules.
